Students will gain a solid understanding of network concepts, models, protocols, and applications. Emphasis is placed on the design and implementation of socket-based network programs, comprising both client and server architectures, and including advanced concepts such as non-blocking sockets, multiplexing, threads, asynchronous programming, and multicasting. Practical skills are developed through hands-on exercises and assignments using selected programing languages.

Course Outcomes: Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

  >Explain the TCP/IP model, network protocols, and security constraints.
  
  >Design, implement, and test network programming for socket-based applications.
  
  >Describe key network programming concepts such as framing, performance, deadlocks, and latency.
  
  >Design, implement, and test advanced network programming concepts such as non-blocking sockets, multiplexing, threads, asynchronous programming, and multicasting.
